Installation
============

Quick Start
-----------

To install the latest version of the package, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install py_veeqo

It is not recommended to install any packages directly 
into the Python environment; consider using `pip` or 
`conda` virtual environments to keep your operating 
system space clean, and to avoid conflicts between projects.

You **do not** need to read the rest of this page if the above command worked.

Verifying the Installation
--------------------------

To verify that the package was installed correctly, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    python -c "import py_veeqo; print(py_veeqo.__version__)"
